# 👋Welcome! I’m Ravi Sai Manohar, an AI Ethics practitioner and founder of SoulMindFusion (SMF) – a mission to align AI systems with ethical clarity and conscious decision-making.

This GitHub showcases projects developed under:

**SMAI-Core** – AI fairness, bias detection, explainability (AIF360, SHAP, YAML governance)

**SMAI-Conscious** – A mindful AI assistant for promoting silence, ethical reflection, and mental energy conservation

These are more than technical experiments — they represent a bridge between responsible AI development and human-centered alignment. Explore the repositories to see AI being shaped by ethics, purpose, and transparency.
