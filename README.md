Welcome! I’m **Ravi Sai Manohar** – an **AI Ethics & Governance practitioner** transitioning from 16+ years of Oracle EBS experience.

This GitHub is home to projects developed under my nonprofit initiative: **SoulMindFusion (SMF)**. The mission is to align artificial intelligence with human clarity, mental energy preservation, and fairness.

Key Repositories:

**smf-smai-core-projects** → AI Fairness, Bias Mitigation, Governance Tools

**smai-conscious-gpt** → Mindful GPT agent for ethical clarity and decision nudges

“AI is not just a tool — it’s a mirror. Through SMF, I aim to build systems that reflect conscious intelligence.”

For full structure: SMF → SMAI → (Core + Conscious) → Ethical & Mindful AI.
